PropertySource

   PropertySource is a way of sourcing a property (i.e. the value for a simple string key) by transparently looking
   in the classpath, defined file system locations, the Java environment and the runtime environment until it can
   resolve the lookup. There is a hierarchy of sources, so that for example a runtime environment definition of a property
   will override a default resolved from the classpath.
